# How To Use

  - You do not need to use a real email address to register, as I have not currently implemeted a proper email-signup yet. It just has to be in an email format.
  - I have run into layout problems on some of the newer versions of most browsers. If everything looks extremly large, just decrease your browser zoom settings.
  - The link you use must be a png, jpg, or some other file format from the web. You cannot use the link to the webpage the image is located at. Just google image search "faces", click an image, right click and select "Copy image". After making sure the link is of a file type, paste it into my webpage, click detect and voila!
  
  
 # What's next?
  - Currently I am working on creating pop-up notifications when you register and sign in. Currently if you sign in with incorrect credentials, the site doesn't notify you. If you register with an invalid email address (i.e. wrong format) it doesn't notify you. I want the site to talk to the user more. This is the start of that.
